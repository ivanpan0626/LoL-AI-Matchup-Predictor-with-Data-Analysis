# LoL-AI-Matchup-Predictor-with-Data-Analysis
 The usage of Riot API and webscraping to extract thousands of player data and champion data. This data is then preprocessed into 3 different sets of data for input into XGB, Random Forest, and Neural Network AI models for compilation, training, and evaluation for accuracy. Which the AI model will be saved and loaded onto my Flask WebApp that will host the AI for match predictions inputted by the users. With the addition of easy retrieval of any player data and champion data in League of Legends for anyone to use for personal or experimental purposes.
